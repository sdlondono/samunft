```javascript
yarn install
```

## Usage

```javascript
yarn dev
```

To use SamuNFT, you will need to provide an Ethereum address as a command-line argument. For example, to find all assets associated with the address `0x2d6eC23E455BC5eD8e1990122f1F392b1fB0233d`.

This will fetch all of the assets associated with the given address using the OpenSea API and display them in the website.
